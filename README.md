Tethne [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jasonzou/tethne-plus.svg?branch=python)](https://travis-ci.com/jasonzou/tethne-plus)
======
Tethne is a Python package for integrated bibliographic and corpus analysis developed by
the Digital Innovation Group at Arizona State University. Tethne provides simple tools
for generating networks from bibliographic datasets, and provides a framework for weaving
together techniques from scientometrics, computational linguistics, topic modeling, and
social influence modeling. Rather than reinvent or re-implement existing algorithms,
Tethne is designed to interface with existing software packages, and to provide
mechanisms for drawing the results and functionalities of those packages together.

----------
We now have a Google group for Tethne users: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tethne-users

Documentation
-------------
For more information, see the Tethne [website](http://diging.github.io/tethne/).

The documentation project (ReST sources, etc.) can be found in [``tethne-docs``](https://github.com/diging/tethne-docs).

Key features
------------
* Flexible core model for text and citation-data.
* Provides core analytic features of popular citation-analysis software (e.g. Citespace).
* Integrates popular topic modeling software (e.g. MALLET).
* Export network models to mainstream formats (e.g. for visualization in Cytoscape).
* Leverages powerful computational and network-analysis libraries in Python.

How to Contribute
-----------------

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository.
2. Check out the ``develop`` branch: ``git checkout develop``
3. Create a new branch for your contribution, e.g. ``git checkout -b issue45``
4. Make your changes. Be sure to include a docstring for each function and
   class!
5. Write tests. We aim for 95% test coverage. Put your tests in ``tests``, where
   they belong.
6. Ensure that all of your tests are passing. We use
   [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). Test with:

   ```shell
   $ nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=tethne --cover-min-percentage=95
   ```
7. Check for code cleanliness! Code should conform to
   [PEP 0008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). We use
   [Pylint](http://www.pylint.org/). For example:

   ```shell
   $ pylint tethne/mycontribution.py
   ```
8. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
   Be sure to select ``diging/develop`` as the base branch.

Requirements
------------
These should be installed automatically when you install Tethne, but just in case they
aren't:

```
networkx>=1.8.1
Unidecode>=0.04.16
iso8601
rdflib
```

New in v0.7
-----------
v0.7 was a nearly ground-up refactor, resulting in a more modular and testable codebase
and a simplified API. Here are some of the most notable changes:
* Network-building functions were made significantly more abstract and flexible.
* Numpy and SciPy are no longer required. We weren't really taking advantage of the
  performance gains afforded by those packages, and some users were running into
  installation issues with SciPy.
* Plotting functionality has been removed. This was causing bloat, and we were making
  aesthetic and formatting decisions for the user that weren't easily customizable.
* Huge improvements to the WoS reader. The old reader was bloated and suffered from some
  nasty bugs.
* Re-designed ``Corpus`` and ``Paper`` classes. See the docs for more information.
* Introduced ``Feature`` and ``FeatureSet`` classes to provide a more consistent and
  user-friendly mechanism for managing document features.
